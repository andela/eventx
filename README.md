What do you do when you have an event and all the event management applications available are too heavy but with little functionality to serve your purpose?
How do organize a small get-together with your friends, without having to go through a rigorous event creation process and without bothering about all the complexities of event management?
> Hmm!! If only there was an app for that? If only i could afford that application, if available?
So many wishes,really!

We created EventX for Event Managers who are not interested in the complexities of Event Management, but want to organize a world-class event!

## Features

Fluid event creation process
Easy to use dashboard

Our Working Document

The creation of EventX was a very interesting and challenging process.
In order to have one of the most robust and dependable applications, we had to collectively think through some of the most complex strategies and model abstractions.

Work is never ended on a great project, therefore we believe that this project will receive continous improvements/additions even as we create the most intuitive and innovative event management application.
